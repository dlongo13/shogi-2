A Shogi implementation in C# + .Net Core. The console app is not yet fully functional as this is still work in progress. The initial approach was quite rudimentary, focusing mainly on OOP/TDD. 
  
Currently I am refactoring the code onto a [bitboard version](Bitboard.md), in order to enable a more efficient approach to movements calculation.
